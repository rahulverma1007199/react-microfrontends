one doubt from lecture zero is how -- index.html knows that it has to fetch content from 'index.js'
answer - their is a convention is single-spa which assume that their is a div exist in index.html and if it doesn't exists then it will create it. and to change that location -- in react exmaple -- inside app object 
domElementGetter(){
    return document.getElementById('different-element');
}
now our render out goes inside it. but you have to create an div with id inside index.html

to pass custom props -- inside registerApplication object -- customProps : {
    authToken : 'asdadaww'
}

and you can access this in Root.jsx

So -- We can write own normal componets inside React and the single-spa helpers will convert a component into a micro-frontend
