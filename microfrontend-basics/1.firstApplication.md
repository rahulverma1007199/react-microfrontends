What is SPA - an application with javascript object with two to three function on it.

So we have bootstrap function -- for one time initialization (this is option but other two are required)
we have mount function - which is showing UI
we have unmount function - to hide the UI

and collection we call above function -- lifecycle functions and they have a specific action, and single spa knows when the action will happen and application itself knows how to perform the action.
each lifecycle function gives props as an argument, which is data to help perform that action. also a lifecycle function must return a promise and that's why we uses async function beacuse they automatically returns promises.
The promise is used to tell single-spa when we are finished action

For better install single-spa extension for developer console.

-- for basics we will use vanila JS, than any its library like React or other and later we use React, for basics refer to microfrontend-basics;

-- for this to work

we do npm init to parent folder and install single-spa and webpack
